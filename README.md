### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Henri, a junior fullstack developer. Ever since I moved from Windows to Linux, I  fell in love with open source and how people come together to create something unique. I try to automate anything that entails repetitions through bash scripts.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working and learning about 21e8, svelte, ts, and of course my vim config
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: hvandersleyen@gmail.com

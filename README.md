### Hey there 👋

I'm Henri, a junior developer/data scientist looking for work in an unforgiving job market for junior dev. Ever since I moved from Windows to Linux, I  fell in love with open source and how people come together to create something unique.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on web dev
- 🌱 I'm currently learning graphql, typeOrm, typescript, express, Svelte, html, css
- 💪 I'm looking to collaborate on beginner typescript projects

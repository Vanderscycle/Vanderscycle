### Hey there 👋

I'm Henri, a junior fullstack developer/data analyst. Ever since I moved from Windows to Linux, I  fell in love with open source and how people come together to create something unique. I tried to automate anything that entails repetitions through bash scripts.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on web dev and in particular the Vue framework
- 🌱 I'm currently learning graphql, typeOrm, typescript, express, Vue, html, css
- 💪 I'm looking to collaborate on beginner typescript/vue projects
- 📫 How to reach me: hvandersleyen@gmail.com
- 🌐 Come visit me on my [website](http://www.neuraldomains.com:8000) before I move on from Django to Vue.
